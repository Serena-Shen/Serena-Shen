Good practices:

Hard-coding the name: into a resource is usually considered to be bad practice. Names should be unique to a release. 

Grammar:
A template directive is enclosed in {{ and }} blocks.

Tricks:
When you want to test the template rendering, but not actually install anything, you can use helm install --debug --dry-run <release-name> <chart-path>
